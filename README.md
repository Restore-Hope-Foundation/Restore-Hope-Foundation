- ⚡ Fun fact: ... I founded the Restore Hope Foundation after covid began taking loved ones from conplete strangers that I sat on a park bench in bethany ok, and el reno oklahoma, for 6 months, as I listened to stories of countless people giving up on everything life, so many lost Hope but as I listened, I also reminded each and everyone of them, Hope might fade now and then but it is never truely gone, you just have to look harder and focus more, youll always find the flicking Hope in the distance, when you see it again, it gives you the strength and desire to finish the last struggle, leading to that victory, that finish line, and oh how you'll remember the struggle and pain, but, it wont seem as bad as you remember it being 

  In ending this chatty females long information, I ask, if there is anyone willing to help a newbie get my future up and going? please please let me know.    you dont know how much id appreciate a kind, helpful, decent human being these days, its been sometime since ive encountered someone with a helpful attitude, for couple years now the only people that came into my story or path was only here to use me, hurt me, embarress me, and steal from me. im ready to know good, kind people .   thanks for taking a minute to read this info.
